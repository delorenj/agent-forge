# üìö AgentForge Tutorial Quick Reference

## üöÄ Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Basic interactive mode
python main.py

# Run example scenario
python main.py --example

# Run tutorial examples
python examples/tutorial_examples.py

# Test installation
python -c "from agents.engineering_manager import EngineeringManager; print('‚úÖ AgentForge ready')"

## üéØ Two Main Approaches

### 1. Fine-Grained Control
**When to use**: You know exactly what specialists you need
**Example goal**: "Create exactly 4 agents: Agno Architect, Agentic Engineer, Data Scientist, Infrastructure Expert"

```python
goal = InputGoal(
    goal_description="Create specific agents: [list exact roles]",
    constraints=["Must include X specialist", "Exactly N agents"],
    complexity_level=ComplexityLevel.HIGH
)
```

### 2. Automated Optimization  
**When to use**: You want maximum efficiency and comprehensive coverage
**Example goal**: "Create optimally balanced team for [project description]"

```python
goal = InputGoal(
    goal_description="Create optimized team for [project]",
    constraints=["Budget-conscious", "Follow tech stack"],
    complexity_level=ComplexityLevel.ENTERPRISE
)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Agent Types

| Agent Type | Best For | Key Capabilities |
|------------|----------|------------------|
| **Agno Agent Architect** | Multi-agent systems | Agno framework, workflow design |
| **Agentic Engineer** | Agent-integrated apps | React/TypeScript + agents |
| **Data Scientist** | Analytics & ML | Python ML, data pipelines |
| **Infrastructure Expert** | Deployment & ops | Kubernetes, monitoring |
| **Full-Stack Architect** | System design | End-to-end architecture |
| **Security Specialist** | Compliance & security | OWASP, SOC 2, penetration testing |
| **QA Engineer** | Testing & quality | Automated testing, CI/CD |

## üîß Complexity Levels Guide

| Level | Description | Team Size | Timeline | Example Projects |
|-------|-------------|-----------|----------|------------------|
| **Low (1)** | Simple, single-purpose | 1-2 agents | 1-2 months | Blog, landing page |
| **Medium (2)** | Multi-component | 2-4 agents | 2-4 months | CRM, dashboard |
| **High (3)** | Complex integration | 4-6 agents | 4-8 months | E-commerce, SaaS |
| **Enterprise (4)** | Mission-critical | 6+ agents | 6+ months | Banking, healthcare |

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Agent creation fails**
```bash
# Check API keys
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY | cut -c1-10
echo $OPENROUTER_API_KEY | cut -c1-10

# Test with simple example
python main.py --example
```

**QDrant connection issues**
```bash
# Check QDrant status
curl http://localhost:6333/health

# Start QDrant if needed
docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant
```

**Generated agents don't match requirements**
```bash
# Review strategy document
cat output/strategy_document.md

# Use more specific constraints
# Add detailed success criteria
# Specify exact agent types needed
```

**Performance issues**
```bash
# Check system resources
htop

# Use lighter models
export MODEL_ID="deepseek/deepseek-v3.1"

# Reduce complexity level
# Use fewer agents
```

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with lower complexity, iterate up
2. **Be Specific**: Detailed constraints = better results
3. **Review Outputs**: Always check strategy and scouting reports
4. **Test Early**: Run generated agents to verify functionality
5. **Iterate**: Refine based on results and feedback

## üìû Getting Help

- **Documentation**: Check `docs/` folder for detailed guides
- **Examples**: Run `python examples/tutorial_examples.py`
- **Logs**: Check `logs/agentforge.log` for debugging
- **Issues**: Open GitHub issue with error details and context
