- **Purpose**: Find existing agents that match your requirements
- **Output**: Scouting Report with matches and gaps
- **Duration**: ~10-20 seconds

### 3. Agent Creation (Agent Developer)
- **Purpose**: Create new agents for any identified gaps
- **Output**: Custom agent specifications and code
- **Duration**: ~30-60 seconds (if gaps exist)

### 4. Team Integration (Integration Architect)
- **Purpose**: Assemble final team and create operational playbook
- **Output**: Complete team documentation and workflow
- **Duration**: ~15-30 seconds

### 5. Final Packaging (Engineering Manager)
- **Purpose**: Package everything for delivery
- **Output**: Ready-to-deploy agent team
- **Duration**: ~5 seconds

## Using AgentForge

## Configuration Options

### Model Selection

Choose different language models based on your needs:

```python
# Fast and cost-effective
em = EngineeringManager(model_id="anthropic/claude-3-haiku")

# Balanced performance (default)  
em = EngineeringManager(model_id="deepseek/deepseek-v3.1")

# High capability for complex tasks
em = EngineeringManager(model_id="openai/gpt-4o")

# Use OpenRouter for model variety
em = EngineeringManager(model_id="openrouter/auto")  # Auto-select best model
```

### Agent Library Configuration

Point AgentForge to your existing agent libraries:

```python
em = EngineeringManager(
    agent_library_path="/home/user/my-agents",
    knowledge_base_path="/home/user/my-knowledge"
)
```

Or set environment variables:
```bash
export AGENT_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/user/my-agents
export TEAMS_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/user/my-teams
```

### Database Configuration

Use different database backends:

```python
# SQLite (default)
em = EngineeringManager(db_file="my_agentforge.db")

# PostgreSQL
em = EngineeringManager(
    db_url="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/agentforge"
)
```

## Interpreting Results

AgentForge returns a comprehensive `TeamPackage` with all the information you need:

### Team Package Structure

```python
class TeamPackage:
    team_name: str                           # Name of your generated team
    goal_summary: str                        # Summary of original goal  
    team_members: List[Dict]                 # List of all agents with roles
    workflow_steps: List[str]                # How the team operates
    communication_protocols: Dict           # Inter-agent communication rules
    strategy_document: str                   # Full strategy analysis (JSON)
    scouting_report: str                     # Agent matching report (JSON)
    roster_documentation: str               # Complete operational playbook  
    new_agents_created: List[Dict]           # Details of new agents
    existing_agents_used: List[Dict]         # Reused agents with match scores
    deployment_instructions: str            # How to deploy this team
    success_metrics: List[str]              # How to measure success
```

### Understanding Team Members

Each team member includes:

```python
{
    "role": "Frontend Developer",           # The role this agent fills
    "type": "new",                         # "new" or "existing"  
    "capabilities": [                      # What this agent can do
        "React development",
        "State management", 
        "Component testing"
    ],
    "source": "agent_developer"           # Where it came from
}
```

### Workflow Steps

The generated workflow typically includes:

1. **Initialize team coordination** - Set up communication protocols
2. **Execute parallel workflows** - Agents work according to their roles
3. **Monitor progress** - Track deliverables and quality gates
4. **Handle coordination** - Manage inter-agent dependencies  
5. **Complete delivery** - Final validation and success metrics

### Communication Protocols

Generated teams include structured communication:

```python
{
    "coordination_hub": "Central message passing system",
    "workflow_handoffs": "Structured handoffs with validation",
    "quality_gates": "Automated quality checks at milestones",
    "error_handling": "Escalation procedures for failures"
}
```

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Goals

#### ‚úÖ Good Goal Examples

```python
# Specific and actionable
goal = "Build a customer support chatbot that integrates with our existing CRM system, handles common queries automatically, and escalates complex issues to human agents"

# Clear domain and context  
goal = "Create a data pipeline for processing financial transactions in real-time, with fraud detection capabilities and regulatory compliance reporting"

# Measurable success criteria
goal = "Develop a content management system that allows non-technical users to publish articles, manage media assets, and track engagement metrics"
```

#### ‚ùå Avoid Vague Goals

```python
# Too generic
goal = "Make a website"

# No clear requirements
goal = "Something with AI"  

# Unrealistic scope
goal = "Build the next Facebook but better"
```

### Providing Context

Always include relevant context:

```python
goal = InputGoal(
    goal_description="Build a customer support chatbot",
    domain="e-commerce",  # Specific domain
    constraints=[
        "Must integrate with Shopify",  # Technical constraints
        "Support for 5 languages",     # Functional constraints  
        "Budget: $50K",                 # Budget constraints
        "Go live in 3 months"          # Time constraints
    ],
    success_criteria=[
        "Handle 80% of common queries",     # Quantifiable metrics
        "Average response time < 5 seconds", # Performance targets
        "95% customer satisfaction",        # Quality metrics
        "Reduce support ticket volume by 50%" # Business impact
    ],
    existing_resources=[
        "Shopify store with 10K products",  # What you already have
        "Customer service team of 5",       # Current resources  
        "AWS cloud infrastructure"          # Technical assets
    ]
)
```

### Complexity Level Guidelines

- **Start with Medium** if unsure - you can always adjust
- **Use High for integration-heavy** projects requiring multiple systems
- **Choose Enterprise only for** mission-critical, large-scale systems
- **Simple is best for** proof-of-concepts and single-function tools

### Iterating on Results

If the generated team doesn't match your expectations:

1. **Refine your goal description** with more specific requirements
2. **Adjust complexity level** up or down based on initial results  
3. **Add more constraints** to guide the team composition
4. **Specify success criteria** more precisely to influence role creation
5. **Include existing resources** to encourage reuse over new creation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "No agents created for my goal"
**Cause**: Goal may be too simple or existing agents fulfill all requirements
**Solution**: 
- Increase complexity level
- Add more specific constraints  
- Check if existing agents in library already cover your needs

#### "Generated agents seem irrelevant"
**Cause**: Goal description may be unclear or domain mismatch
**Solution**:
- Provide more specific goal description
- Ensure domain accurately reflects your project
- Add detailed success criteria

#### "Process takes too long"  
**Cause**: Complex goals or slow model responses
**Solution**:
- Try a faster model like `anthropic/claude-3-haiku`
- Reduce complexity level for initial testing
- Check your internet connection and API limits

#### "API errors or timeouts"
**Cause**: API key issues or rate limiting
**Solution**:
- Verify API keys in `.env` file
- Check API key permissions and quotas
- Try switching between OpenAI and OpenRouter

### Error Messages

#### `ImportError: No module named 'agno'`
```bash
pip install agno>=2.0.2
```

#### `ValidationError: field required`  
Check that all required fields are provided in your `InputGoal`:
- `goal_description` (required)
- `domain` (required)

#### `FileNotFoundError: agent library path`
Set the correct path in your environment:
```bash
export AGENT_LIBRARY_PATH=/correct/path/to/agents
```
