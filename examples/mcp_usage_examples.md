🔄 INTERACTION WORKFLOW:

1. Data Collection & Processing:
   Data Pipeline Engineer → Analytics Engineer
   (Raw data → Processed features)

2. Model Development:
   Feature Engineering Specialist → ML Engineer
   (Features → Trained models)

3. Deployment:
   ML Engineer → ML Model Deployment Engineer
   (Trained models → Production models)

4. Integration:
   ML Model Deployment Engineer → Backend Integration Engineer
   (Model serving → API endpoints)

5. Monitoring & Iteration:
   Analytics Engineer → ML Engineer
   (Performance metrics → Model improvements)

## Tips for Effective MCP Usage

### 1. Start with Strategy
For complex projects, use `agentforge_analyze_strategy` first to understand requirements before creating the full team.

### 2. Maximize Reuse
Always use `agentforge_scout_agents` to find existing agents before creating new ones. This saves time and maintains consistency.

### 3. Use Quick Agent for Simple Needs
For one-off agents, `agentforge_quick_agent` is faster than the full workflow.

### 4. Monitor Progress
Use `agentforge_get_workflow_status` to track long-running team creations.

### 5. Keep Libraries Fresh
Run `agentforge_reindex_libraries` whenever you add new agents to ensure they're discoverable.

### 6. Iterate on Teams
You can create multiple teams for the same goal with different constraints to compare approaches.

---

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: Progressive Refinement
```
1. "Analyze requirements for X"
   → agentforge_analyze_strategy

2. "Scout for those agents"
   → agentforge_scout_agents

3. "Create the missing agents"
   → agentforge_develop_agents

4. "Now create the full team with all context"
   → agentforge_create_team
```

### Pattern: Quick Prototyping
```
"Quick create agents for:
- Role A with capabilities X, Y
- Role B with capabilities Z, W"

→ Multiple agentforge_quick_agent calls
→ Fast team assembly
```

### Pattern: Library Growth
```
1. Create agents for project A
   → agentforge_create_team

2. Reindex library
   → agentforge_reindex_libraries

3. Create agents for project B (reuses from A!)
   → agentforge_create_team with high reuse efficiency
```
