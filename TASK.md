# Task

**Main Goal**:
Implement the Agno Agent System described in ./PRD.md

**Instructions**:

1. Read the PRD.md file to understand the requirements and specifications of the Agno Agent System.
  - The PRD contains a detailed roster of agent descriptions to guide the implementation.

2. Create the root Orchestrator agent that will manage and coordinate the other agents.
  - Ensure the Orchestrator has a deep knowledge and understandign of the Agno Agent System and access to the agno documentation mcp server

3. Create the individual agents as described in the PRD.md file.
  - Each agent should have a specific role and functionality as outlined in the PRD.
  - Ensure that each agent can communicate effectively with the Orchestrator and other agents as needed

4. Spin up the all the agents, including the Orchestrator and hand over control to the Orchestrator.

5. [Orchestrator] Break down the implementation into manageable tasks and create a project plan.
  - Ensure each task is clearly defined and assigned to the appropriate agent.
  - Each task should have a clear objective and deliverable.
  - The deliverables should all be in markdown format.
  - Each deliverable should have a clear set of quantifiable acceptance criteria.
  - Each deliverable should be delivered first to the Orchestrator for review before being propagated to the next agent that needs it. If the deliverable is not accepted, it should be sent back to the agent that created it with clear feedback on what needs to be improved or changed.

6. [Orchestrator] Monitor the progress of each agent and ensure that they are on track to meet their deadlines.
  - Provide support and guidance as needed
  - Make sure to showcase features as they are completed by prompting the user with human-in-to-loop messages to ensure alignment with the overall vision of the Agno Agent System.

*Continue to repeat steps 5 and 6 until all tasks are completed and all deliverables are accepted.*

7. Invoke the Documentation agent to generate the documentation for the Agno Agent System.
  - Ensure that all code is well-documented and follows best practices.
  - Create a comprehensive README file that explains how to set up and use the Agno Agent System.
