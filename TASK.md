# TASKS

- [ ] Running `agentforge` without params should print help message instead of error
- [ ] Add `--version|-v` flag to print version of the tool
- [ ] Command `roster` should print a list of available agents with short description

## New Requirements Going Forward

- [ ] The agents should be serializable to/from some-agent.af using Letta's [agentfile spec](https://github.com/letta-ai/agent-file)
- [ ] There should be an interactive mode where the user can create agents or select agents and configure them step-by-step
